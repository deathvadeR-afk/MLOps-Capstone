frontend/
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ index.html
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ favicon.ico
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ SentimentAnalyzer.js
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ResultDisplay.js
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ App.js
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ App.css
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ index.js
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json
â””â”€â”€ README.md
```

âœ… **COMPLETED**

3. Document the new API endpoints

âœ… **COMPLETED**

## Task 3: Deploy Application to Render (Free Tier)

### Overview
Deploy both the Flask backend and React frontend to Render's free tier for public access without AWS costs.

### Implementation Steps

#### Step 1: Prepare Backend for Render Deployment
Create Render configuration files for the Flask backend:

1. Create render.yaml for backend service configuration
2. Ensure all dependencies are properly listed
3. Test the application locally with Render-like environment variables

âœ… **COMPLETED**

#### Step 2: Prepare Frontend for Render Deployment
Create Render configuration for the React frontend:

1. Ensure package.json has proper build scripts
2. Test the build process locally
3. Configure API endpoint URLs for Render deployment

âœ… **COMPLETED**

#### Step 3: Set Up Render Account and Deploy
Deploy both services to Render:

1. Create a free Render account
2. Connect GitHub repository
3. Deploy backend as Web Service
4. Deploy frontend as Static Site
5. Configure environment variables for DagsHub credentials

ðŸ•’ **Pending** - Requires user to create Render account and deploy

#### Step 4: Configure Custom Domains (Optional)
Set up custom domains if desired:

1. Purchase or configure domain names
2. Set up DNS records in Render
3. Configure SSL certificates

ðŸ•’ **Pending** - Optional step

## Task 4: Maintain Existing MLOps Tools

### Overview
Keep all existing MLOps tools (MLflow, DagsHub, DVC, Prometheus, Grafana) functioning as they are, since they're compatible with Render deployment.

### Implementation Steps

#### Step 1: Verify MLflow/DagsHub Integration
Ensure MLflow continues to work with Render:

1. Test environment variable configuration in Render
2. Verify model loading from DagsHub
3. Confirm experiment tracking still works

ðŸ•’ **Pending** - Will be verified during deployment

#### Step 2: Maintain DVC Workflows
Keep DVC functioning for local development:

1. Document that DVC is only needed locally
2. Ensure DVC pipelines still work for experiment reproduction
3. Confirm model registration process continues to work

ðŸ•’ **Pending** - Will be verified during deployment

#### Step 3: Preserve Prometheus Metrics
Keep Prometheus metrics endpoint available:

1. Verify /metrics endpoint works on Render
2. Document how to set up external Prometheus scraping
3. Confirm all custom metrics are still collected

ðŸ•’ **Pending** - Will be verified during deployment

#### Step 4: Document Tool Usage
Update documentation to explain tool usage with Render:

1. Explain which tools work locally vs. remotely
2. Document environment variable requirements
3. Provide troubleshooting guidance

ðŸ•’ **Pending** - Will be completed after deployment

## Task 5: Remove Kubernetes Dependencies
